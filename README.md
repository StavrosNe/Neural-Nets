# Custom Neural Network Implementations

This repository contains custom implementations of neural network architectures in Python. Currently, it includes implementations for:

1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
3. Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)

## Overview

These implementations are designed to provide a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of neural networks. They are built from scratch, allowing for a granular view of the network's operations.
